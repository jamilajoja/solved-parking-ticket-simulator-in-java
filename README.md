For this assignment you will design a set of classes that work together to simulate a police officer issuing a parking ticket. The classes you should design are:

–      To know the car’s, make, model, color, license number, and the number of minutes that the car has been parked.

·         The ParkingMeter Class: This class should simulate a parking meter. The class’s only responsibility is:

–      To report the amount of the fine which is $25 for the first hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked, plus $01 for every additional hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked part of an hour that the car is illegally parked.
